## Overview
  This is a beginer project driven by integrating a clock with a countdown timer functionality. The aim is to create a simple, user-friendly interface enabling users to effortlessly add and manage multiple independent countdown timers.
### The challenge
Users should be able to:

- Create a clock that shows the current time
- create a countdown Timer feature with the ability to add new timers
- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- **Bonus**: See the chat interface animate on the initial load
